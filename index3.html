      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>There are many ways to start a project. I believe the process you take to design a project is one of the most crucial and important parts leading to the outcome. I struggled with completeting projects that I wanted to create. And even today I still struggle with my creative process. I would get frustrated becuase I didnt know where to start or if it would even be worth it. You always want your projects to come out special and have everyone get behind you and say you did a good job. But this is not a perfect world. You have to design a process and gather tools even before your idea is even presented to anyone. These are the things nobody else can see except you. It is what makes the difference between doing and not doing. I had to come up with a process that allows me to create more smoothly and efficiently. I believe I can improve and use better tools to create better and faster. Becoming more efficient takes practice and trying new things.</p>
        <h1>Idea</h1>
        <p>My projects start as an idea. I will take notes or state the problem I'm solving. Answer questions to myself and have things written out. That could be done in many ways so there are no limits. I choose to use my iPad for example to create on the various Adobe apps.</p>
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>I then choose which tools I will use that can help me produce what it is I am designing. It could be a pencil and paper to draw. My iPad has become my favorite tool. But there are many options out there to create. Your only limited by the tools you haven't learned to use. That alone lets me know I still have a lot to improve upon. </p>
        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>Since my focus is web development I must understand the languages of the web. I use these languages to tell the computer how to display what I have designed. There are many technologies that can improve my design process, and they can be overwelming to choose from but getting started with the basics will surely lead you to a finished project and the next step would be just to keep on learning and improving. I always remind myself even the best in the business are constantly improving so I also have to improve. Its continuous and apart of the fun. </p>
