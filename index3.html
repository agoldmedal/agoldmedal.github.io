      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>I'm still in the process of developing a professional design process. I have experience with professional design software such as the Adobe CC Suite. I'm still learning a lot and there are always new technologies to try out.</p>
        <h1>Idea</h1>
        <p>My projects start as an idea. I will take notes or state the problem I'm solving. Answer questions to myself and have things written out. That could be done in many ways so there are no limits. I choose to use my iPad for example to create on the various Adobe apps.</p>
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>I then choose which tools I will use that can help me produce what it is I am designing. It could be a pencil and paper to draw. My iPad has become my favorite tool. But there are many options out there to create. Your only limited by the tools you haven't learned to use. That alone lets me know I still have a lot to improve upon. </p>
        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>Since my focus is web development I must understand the languages of the web. I use these languages to tell the computer how to display what I have designed. There are many technologies that can improve my design process, and they can be overwelming to choose from but getting started with the basics will surely lead you to a finished project and the next step would be just to keep on learning and improving. I always remind myself even the best in the business are constantly improving so I also have to improve. Its continuous and apart of the fun. </p>
