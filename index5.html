      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. My passion is geared towards technology and art. Technology allows the world to be greatly interconnected and art allows us to express ourselves. Today we are able to communicate and share our creativity with anyone around the world instantly and we are only becoming more advanced. My focus is currently developing my design and web development skills and use it as a tool to be able to create. I'm currently interested in designing with computer languages and advancing my design process with software. My goal is to learn more advanced technologies and work to solve problems that will continue to keep our world moving forward.</p>
